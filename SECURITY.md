## Security Measures

### Authentication
- JWT tokens are used for secure authentication
- Tokens expire after a configurable period
- Strong secret keys are required for production deployments

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data is never committed to the repository
- Environment variables are used for configuration
- Database connections are secured with proper credentials

### API Security
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- CORS policies protect against unauthorized cross-origin requests
- Input validation prevents injection attacks

### Network Security
- HTTPS is required for production deployments
- Secure headers are implemented
- Regular security audits are performed

## Security Best Practices

For production deployments, we recommend:

1. Always use strong, randomly generated secret keys
2. Configure proper CORS origins for your domain
3. Use HTTPS for all communications
4. Regularly update dependencies
5. Monitor logs for suspicious activity
6. Implement proper database backup procedures
7. Use PostgreSQL for production
